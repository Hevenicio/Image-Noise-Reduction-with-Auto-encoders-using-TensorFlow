## Project Description
Auto-encoding is an algorithm to help reduce dimensionality of data with the help of neural networks. It can be used for lossy data compression where the compression is dependent on the given data. This algorithm to reduce dimensionality of data as learned from the data can also be used for reducing noise in data.

**The project was carried out according to the following steps:**
- Importing Libraries + Introduction,
- Data Pre-processing,
- Adding Noise,
- Building and Training a Classifier,
- Building the Auto-encoder,
- Training the Auto-encoder,
- De-noised Images,
- Composite Model.
